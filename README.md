# MaimaiPy

A backend chart/music database utilising flask and flask-sqlalchemy. Originally forked from a maimai standalone python application, this is now planned to become both a standalone app (utilising sqlalchemy), and a flask backend server that is able to process chart data and fetch urls stored on official servers.

A web scraping implementation for standalone imports will be implemented further down the line, focusing on functionality via JSON readily available from other maimai tools first.

*Random notes*
Hopefully I dont get sidetracked again.
